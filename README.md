<h1>Macaca Website</h1>

<h2>What is Macaca?</h2>
Macaca is a passion project I am working on. Each projectunder it will have a page on the website where visitors will be able to to demo basic functionality of each project.
As such, all projects will have a specialized GUI on the site and will have accessible APIs.
I plan to make this a life long project and will make sure this project is always constantly updated. Each project featured on the website will also have a link to their respective repos so please feel free to star and send in PRs.

This repo will be the gateway to access the APIs all other projects will expose (over HTTP). As such the <a href = "https://github.com/mr-m0nkey/macaca-ui">user interface</a> will communicate with only this gateway.
