# Macaca Website

##What is Macaca?
Macaca is a passion project I am working on. Each project will have a page on the site where visitors will be able to to demo basic functionality of each project.
As such, all projects will have a specialized GUI on the site and will have accessible APIs.
I plan to make this a life long project and will make sure this project is always constantly updated. Each project featured on the website will also have a link to their respective repos so please feel free to star and send in PRs.
